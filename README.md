# Custom-file-extension<br/>
Me learning how to make my own file extension.<br/>
<br/>
# Installation<br/>
This code requires Python 3.7 to run and you can download Python 3.7 here: https://www.python.org/downloads/<br/>
<br/>
# Make your own file extension<br/>
To make your own file extension simply change the name of the .NAMES file with your own extension and change the name of the file in the Python code.<br/>
<br/>
**The following is not required and is only so you can get errors and syntax colouring for the custom file**<br/>
The custom file is written in JSON and must follow JSON syntax if you wish to edit it. To make this process easier follow these steps for Visual Studio Code (as I do not know how to do this in other editors):<br/>
1. Open your custom file with VS Code<br/>
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P while the file is open in your editor<br/>
3. Type "Change Language Mode" without the quotes and press enter<br/>
4. Click "Configure File Association for '.[Your Extension]'..."<br/>
5. Search for JSON and click on the JSON option (I am not sure what the JSON with comments option does so unless you do don't use that one)
